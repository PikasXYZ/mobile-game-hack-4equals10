# mobile-game-hack-4equals10

This project is designed to crack a mobile game named "4=10" ([official website](https://fourequalsten.app/)). In this game, you get 4 numbers and some usable operators in each stage. And the goal is to make the result equal 10 with those given operators which is not always contains all of the "＋", "－", "×", "÷".
